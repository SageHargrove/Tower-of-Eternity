"""
DEEDS — permanent one-line records of a hero's accomplishments.

Extracted from real combat results (the log + structured fields already
know every dramatic moment), stored forever, shown in Hero Detail — and a
dead hero's deeds remain, so the Memorial can tell their story.

Kept intentionally selective: max 2 deeds per hero per fight, priority-
ordered, exact-duplicate texts skipped — a deed should feel EARNED, not
like a combat log with delusions of grandeur.
