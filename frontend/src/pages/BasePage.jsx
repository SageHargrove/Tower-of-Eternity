  "Training Grounds": "Where the bench gets stronger without risking the Tower. Each assigned hero runs a solo DRILL — Focus (XP), Conditioning (permanently raise a stat, capped by this facility's level), Meditation (Mental aptitude + reveal hidden ones), or Weapon Drills (grind a specific skill). Set an intensity to trade faster gains for fatigue & stress. Two heroes can also SPAR: peers (similar level) both gain, or a veteran can MENTOR a rookie — pouring in XP, teaching a skill, and building a combat bond.",

  "Infirmary": "Passively heals TRAUMA over time and crafts Bandages (auto-used on your most injured heroes before the next floor). Medics and Priests heal fastest.",
  "Vault": "Each upgrade expands equipment storage capacity. Assigned caretakers don't affect capacity — they just earn passive XP while minding the shelves.",

This is where magic battleships will be built: Magic Engineers craft the greatest hulls, but any high-Mental hero can apprentice here for a basic vessel.",

  "Shrine": "Assigned clergy slowly deepen the whole roster's LOYALTY (affinity) — the same track gifts raise, and the one that decides whether a captured hero stays yours. Priests and Acolytes are twice as effective.",
  "Mage Tower": "Conducts magical research for permanent upgrades. Magic Engineers are the most effective researchers, then Mages, then Spellswords.",
  "Athenaeum": "The company's research hall. Assigned scholars generate INSIGHT that flows into whichever study is active on the research map — five disciplines, plus emergent confluences where two mastered schools weave together. Mages and Magic Engineers study fastest.",
